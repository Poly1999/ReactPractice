## Project Overview ðŸ“Œ
This project was created as part of my **React learning journey**.  
The goal was to practice working with **forms** in React: controlled and uncontrolled components, validation, checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, debounce, and popular form libraries.


## Tech Stack ðŸ› 
- **React** (Hooks: `useState`, `useRef`, `useEffect`)
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **HTML5 / CSS3**
- **Formik** â€” Form management
- **React Hook Form** â€” Lightweight form handling


## Features âœ¨
- Controlled and uncontrolled form components
- Form validation (min & max length)
- Handling checkboxes and radio buttons
- Using select dropdowns for filtering tasks
- Debounce for optimizing input performance
- Working with **Formik** and **React Hook Form**
- Filtering tasks by status: Active / Completed / All
